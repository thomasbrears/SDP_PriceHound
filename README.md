## PriceHound
Welcome to the **PriceHound** repository. This project is being developed as part of our university course, COMP602: Software Development Practices at Auckland University of Technology (AUT) in Aotearoa New Zealand.

## Purpose
The primary goal of **PriceHound** is to help people find the best deals on products they love from the comfort of their couch. This project allows us to explore various technologies, development methodologies, and best practices in software development well utilising a modern tech stack.

This project uses a variety of technologies and tools to achieve our goals:
- **React**: Frontend library used to build the user interface.
- **Node.js & Express**: Backend framework used to create the server and API endpoints.
- **Puppeteer**: A Node library used for web scraping to gather data from websites.

- **Various Other Libraries**: We incorporated a range of other libraries for miscellaneous tasks and enhancements throughout the project.
